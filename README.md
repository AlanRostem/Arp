# Arp Scripting Language
 Arp is an embedded scripting language running on an intepreter implemented in C#. 
 This language is inspired by Lua and strives to achieve almost the same performance and effect, but the syntax is similar to JavaScript or C# itself, making it a more familiar experience for scripters.
